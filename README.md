# Self-Hosted Durable Task Worker in Asp .Net Core

This project enables running DurableTask without a sidecar project, 
allowing the worker to be self-hosted. It provides a seamless way to integrate 
Durable Task functionality directly into your Asp .Net Core project.

## Usage

Install the [![NuGet version (Sisu.DurableTask.AspNetCore)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/vpre/Sisu.DurableTask.AspNetCore)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Sisu.DurableTask.AspNetCore/) package.

```
dotnet add package Sisu.DurableTask.AspNetCore
```

> [!NOTE]
> To respect the DurableTask domain and reserve it for official packages, 
I added a prefix to the project assembly. In Finnish culture, **sisu** represents determination, perseverance, and resilience, which felt like a fitting touch!

Then, register the host with your preferred [orchestration service](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-persistance-stores)

``` csharp
using DurableTask.AspNetCore;
using DurableTask.AzureStorage;

var orchestrationServiceAndClient = new AzureStorageOrchestrationService(new()
{
    StorageAccountClientProvider = new StorageAccountClientProvider("...."),
});

builder.Services.AddSelfHostedDurableTaskHub(orchestrationServiceAndClient);
```

Finally, register the [durabletask-dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-dotnet) services and add `UseSelfHosted` to both the worker and client.

``` csharp
using Microsoft.DurableTask;
using Microsoft.DurableTask.Client;
using Microsoft.DurableTask.Worker;

// Add all the generated tasks
builder.Services.AddDurableTaskWorker(builder =>
{
    builder
        .AddTasks(r => r.AddAllGeneratedTasks());
        .UseSelfHosted();
});

builder.Services.AddDurableTaskClient(b => b.UseSelfHosted());

```

Now you can inject the `DurableTaskClient` into your classes to schedule or manage durable tasks. For more detailed examples, check out the samples folder.

## Under the Hood


The [durabletask-dotnet](https://github.com/microsoft/durabletask-dotnet) project is built on top of 
the [Durable Task Framework](https://github.com/Azure/durabletask?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-persistance-stores). 
It provides an easy way to run durable tasks using Dependency Injection and `IHostedService` as a background service in your application. 
One of its standout features is a type-safe source generator for orchestrators and activities, making it a breeze to work with. However,
"It's specifically designed to connect to a "sidecar" process, such as the Azure Functions .NET Isolated host, a special purpose sidecar container, or potentially even Dapr.",
so it use gRPC to communicate with the sidecar. In this project the gRPC communication 
is replaced with a direct call to the `DurableTaskHub` service that runs in the same process.
